237. Throughout January and February 1992, Microsoft executives debated and wordsmithed what "message" should be inserted in the released version of Windows 3.1. Microsoft's purported justification now -- that PSS asked it be included to aid support -- is not mentioned. Instead, the goal was "to spin this more towards the notion that windows and ms-dos are two integral pieces to one operating system, not separate independent pieces." Exhibit 265. At the same time, the executives looked for a clever way to say the detection was not of DR DOS, which -- semantics aside -- it plainly was. Indeed, at one point as late as January 28, 1992, the message was to state: "The Windows setup program has detected another operating system on your machine." Exhibit 270. This prompted Silverberg's concern:

i am wondering if we should change the detection words to say we failed to detect ms-dos, rather than say we detected an os other than ms-dos. the latter words would make people think we are looking for drdos . . . .

238. By February 7, 1992, Silverberg reported that "steveb said put in a kindler gentler message." Exhibit 275. This prompted an exchange between Cole and Silverberg three days later that laid bare the exact purpose behind this entire scheme:

Cole:

A kind-gentle message in setup would probably not offend anyone and probably won't get the press up in arms, but I don't think it serves much of a warning. BillP made an excellent point, what is the guy supposed to do?

Silverberg:

what the guy is supposed to do is **feel uncomfortable, and when he has bugs, suspect that the problem is dr-dos and then go out to buy ms-dos.** or decide to not take the risk for the other machines he has to buy for in the office.
